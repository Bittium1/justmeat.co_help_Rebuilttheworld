| ------------- | ----- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Phytic acid | Bran of grains and pseudo-grains, all kind of seeds, nuts, legumes, potatoes. | Birds and ruminant animals: phytaseenzyme. Partially by soaking, cooking, fermenting, sprouting. | Binding with minerals of food in the gut: deficiency of iron, zinc, calcium and other minerals. Reduces the digestibility of starches, proteins, and fats. |
| Lectins | Grains, pseudo-grains, seeds, nuts, legumes, nightshade vegetables, diary, eggs. | Cooking with seaweeds and mucilaginous vegetables (okra). Partially by soaking, boiling in water, fermenting, sprouting. Wheat, soy, peanuts and dried beans are the most resistant to neutralization. | Leaky gut, neurodegenerative disease, inflammatory diseases, infectious and autoimmune diseases, blood clotting. |
| Saponins | Legumes, pseudo-grains, potatoes, red wine. | Different results in studies for soaking, cooking and fermentation. Cholesterol and bile. | Leaky-gut, disturbs digestive enzymes. |

| Exorphins | Gluten-containing cereals are a main food staple present in the daily human diet, including wheat, barley, and rye. | Gluten intake is associated with the development of celiac disease (CD) and related disorders such as diabetes mellitus type I, depression, and schizophrenia. However, until now, there is no consent about the possible deleterious effects of gluten intake because of often failing symptoms even in persons with proven CD. Asymptomatic CD (ACD) is present in the majority of affected patients and is characterized by the absence of classical gluten-intolerance signs, such as diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Nevertheless, these individuals very often develop diseases that can be related with gluten intake. Gluten can be degraded into several morphine-like substances, named gluten exorphins.These compounds have proven opioid effects and could mask the deleterious effects of gluten protein on gastrointestinal lining and function. Here we describe a putative mechanism, explaining how gluten could mask its own toxicity by exorphins that are produced through gluten protein digestion. The precise pathway leading to the development of ACD still needs to be discovered. However, the putative mechanism presented in this review could explain this intruding phenomenon. The incomplete breakdown of the gluten protein, resulting in the presence of gliadin peptides with opioid effects, makes it plausible to suggest that the opioid effects of gluten exorphins could be responsible for the absence of classical gastrointestinal symptoms of individuals suffering from gluten-intake-associated diseases. Moreover, the partial digestion of gluten, leading to DPP IV inhibition, could also account for the presence of extra-intestinal symptoms and disorders in ACD and the occurrence of intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms and disorders in CD and NCGS patients. If so, then individuals suffering from any of these conditions should be recognized in time and engage in a gluten-free lifestyle to prevent gluten-induced symptoms and disorders. |

## Dietary Pesticides (99.99% All Natural) by Bruce Ames

**Bruce Ames is the inventor of the Ames test, a system for easily and cheaply testing the mutagenicity of compounds.**

**Abstract**

The toxicological significance of exposures to synthetic chemicals is examined in the context of exposures to naturally occurring chemicals. It is calculated that 99.99% (by weight) of the pesticides in the American diet are chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves. Only 52 natural pesticides have been tested in high-dose animal cancer tests, and about half (27) are rodent carcinogens; these 27 are shown to be present in many common foods. It is concluded that natural and synthetic chemicals are equally likely to be positive in animal cancer tests. It is also concluded that at the low doses of most human exposures the comparative hazard synthetic pesticide residues are insignificant.

Concentrations of natural pesticides in plants are usually measured in parts per thousand or million (16-23) rather than parts per billion, the usual concentration of synthetic pesti- cide residues or of water pollutants (1, 24). It is estimated that humans ingest roughly 5000 to 10,000 different natural pes- ticides and their breakdown products (16-23). For example, Table 1 shows 49 natural pesticides (and metabolites) that are ingested when cabbage is eaten, and indicates how few have been tested for carcinogenicity or clastogenicity. Lima beans contain a completely different array of 23 natural toxins that, in stressed plants, range in concentration from 0.2 to 33 parts per thousand fresh weight; none appears to have been tested yet for carcinogenicity or teratogenicity (19). Many Legumi- nosae contain canavanine, a toxin arginine analog that, after being eaten by animals, is incorporated into protein in place of arginine. Feeding alfalfa sprouts (1.5% canavanine dry weight) or canavanine to monkeys causes a lupus erythema- tosus-like syndrome (44). Lupus in humans is characterized by a defect in the immune system that is associated with autoimmunity, anti-nuclear antibodies, chromosome breaks, and various types of pathology. The toxicity of nonfood plants is well known: plants are among the most commonly ingested poisonous substances for children under 5 years. Surprisingly few plant toxins have been tested for carci- nogenicity (10-13, 45). Among 1052 chemicals tested in at least one species in chronic cancer tests, only 52 are naturally occurring plant pesticides (10-13). Among these, about half (27/52) are carcinogenic. 11 Even though only a tiny proportion of the plant toxins in the human diet have been tested so far, the 27 natural pesticides that are rodent carcinogens are present in the following foods: anise, apple, apricot, banana, basil, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, caraway, carrot, cauliflower, celery, cherries, cinnamon, cloves, co- coa, coffee, collard greens, comfrey herb tea, currants, dill, eggplant, endive, fennel, grapefruit juice, grapes, guava, honey, honeydew melon, horseradish, kale, lentils, lettuce, mango, mushrooms, mustard, nutmeg, orange juice, parsley, parsnip, peach, pear, peas, black pepper, pineapple, plum, potato, radish, raspberries, rosemary, sesame seeds, tarra- gon, tea, tomato, and turnip. Thus, it is probable that almost every fruit and vegetable in the supermarket contains natural plant pesticides that are rodent carcinogens. The levels of these 27 rodent carcinogens in the above plants are com- monly thousands of times higher than the levels of synthetic pesticides. Table 2 shows a variety of natural pesticides that are rodent carcinogens occurring in the parts-per-million range in plant foods. The catechol-type phenolics, such as tannins, and caffeic acid and its esters (chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acids), are more widespread in plant species than other natural pesticides (e.g., Tables 1 and 2).

Dietary Pesticides Are 99.99% All Natural. Nature's pesti- cides are one important subset of natural chemicals. Plants produce toxins to protect themselves against fungi, insects, and animal predators (5, 16-23). Tens of thousands of these natural pesticides have been discovered, and every species of plant analyzed contains its own set of perhaps a few dozen toxins. When plants are stressed or damaged, such as during a pest attack, they may greatly increase their natural pesti- cide levels, occasionally to levels that can be acutely toxic to humans. We estimate that Americans eat about 1.5 g of natural pesticides per person per day, which is about 10,000 times more than they eat of synthetic pesticide residues (see below). As referenced in this paper (see refs. 16-21 and legends to Tables 1 and 2), there is a very large literature on natural toxins in plants and their role in plant defenses. The human intake of these toxins varies markedly with diet and would be higher in vegetarians. Our estimate of 1.5 g of natural pesticides per person per day is based on the content of toxins in the major plant foods (e.g., 13 g of roasted coffee per person per day contains about 765 mg of chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and caffeine; see refs. 22 and 23 and Table 2). Phenolics from other plants are esti- mated to contribute another several hundred milligrams of toxins. Flavonoids and glucosinolates account for several hundred milligrams; potato and tomato toxins may contribute another hundred, and saponins from legumes another hun- dred. Grains such as white flour and white rice contribute very little, but whole wheat, brown rice, and corn (maize) may contribute several hundred milligrams more. The per- centage of a plant's weight that is toxin varies, but a few percent of dry weight is a reasonable estimate: e.g., 1.5% of alfalfa sprouts is canavanine and 4% of coffee beans is phenolics. However, the percentage in some plant cultivars is lower (e.g., potatoes and tomatoes).

| Food | Pesticides and Metabolites |

| Cabbage | Glucosinolates: 2-propenyl glucosinolate (sinigrin),\* 3-methylthiopropyl glucosinolate, 3-methylsulfinylpropyl glucosinolate, 3-butenyl glucosinolate, 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl glucosinolate, 4-methylthiobutyl glucosinolate, 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate, 4-methylsulfonylbutyl glucosinolate, benzyl glucosinolate, 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate, propyl glucosinolate, butyl glucosinolate Indole glucosinolates and related indoles: 3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin), indole-3-carbinol,\* indole-3-acetonitrile, bis(3-indolyl)methane Isothiocyanates and goitrin: allyl isothiocyanate,\* 3-methylthiopropyl isothiocyanate, 3-methylsulfinylpropyl isothiocyanate, 3-butenyl isothiocyanate, 5-vinyloxazolidine-2-thione (goitrin), 4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate, 4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate, 4-methylsulfonylbutyl isothiocyanate, 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate, benzyl isothiocyanate, phenylethyl isothiocyanate Cyanides: 1-cyano-2,3-epithiopropane, 1-cyano-3,4-epithiobutane, 1-cyano-3,4-epithiopentane, threo-1-cyano-2-hydroxy-3,4-epithiobutane, erythro-1-cyano-2-hydroxy-3,4-epithiobutane, 2-phenylpropionitrile, allyl cyanide,\* 1-cyano-2-hydroxy-3-butene, 1-cyano-3- methylsulfinylpropane, 1-cyano-4-methylsulfinylbutane Terpenes: menthol, neomenthol, isomenthol, carvone\* Phenols: 2-methoxyphenol, 3-caffoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid),\* 4-caffoylquinic acid,\* 5-caffoylquinic acid (neochlorogenic acid),\* 4-(p-coumaroyl)quinic acid, 5-(p-coumaroyl)quinic acid, 5-feruloylquinic acid

Discussed below; all others untested. Clastogenicity. Chlorogenic acid (25) and allyl isothiocyanate are positive (26). Chlorogenic acid and its metabolite caffeic acid are also mutagens (27-29), as is allyl isothiocyanate (30). Carcinogenicity. Allyl isothiocyanate induced papillomas of the bladder in male rats (a neoplasm that is unusually rare in control rats) and was classified by the National Toxicology Program as carcinogenic. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in mice; however, it was stated "the mice probably did not receive the MTD" (31, 32). Sinigrin (allyl glucosinolate, i.e., thioglycoside of allyl isothiocyanate) is cocarcinogenic for the rat pancreas (33). Carvone is negative in mice (34). Indole-3-acetonitrile has been shown to form a carcinogen, nitroso indole acetonitrile, in the presence of nitrite (35). Caffeic acid is a carcinogen (36, 37) and clastogen (25) and is a metabolite of its esters 3-, 4-, and 5-caffoylquinic acid (chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid). Metabolites. Sinigrin gives rise to allyl isothiocyanate when raw cabbage (e.g., coleslaw) is eaten; in cooked cabbage it also is metabolized to allyl cyanide, which is untested. Indole-3-carbinol forms dimers and trimers on ingestion, which mimic dioxin. Occurrence. See refs. 18, 21, and 38-40\. Toxicology. The mitogenic effects of goitrin (which is goitrogenic) and various organic cyanides from cabbage suggest that they may be potential carcinogens. Aromatic cyanides related to those from cabbage have been shown to be mutagens and are metabolized to hydrogen cyanide and potentially mutagenic aldehydes.

**Cooking Food.**

The cooking of food is also a major dietary source of potential rodent carcinogens. Cooking produces about 2 g (per person per day) of mostly untested burnt material that contains many rodent carcinogens-e.g., poly- cyclic hydrocarbons (81, 91), heterocyclic amines (92, 93), furfural (22, 23), nitrosamines and nitroaromatics (1, 94)-as well as a plethora of mutagens (91-95). Thus, the number and amounts of carcinogenic (or total) synthetic pesticide resi- dues appear to be minimal compared to the background of naturally occurring chemicals in the diet. Roasted coffee, for example, is known to contain 826 volatile chemicals (22); 21 have been tested chronically and 16 are rodent carcinogens (10-13); caffeic acid, a nonvolatile rodent carcinogen, is also present (Table 2). A typical cup of coffee contains at least 10 mg (40 ppm) of rodent carcinogens (mostly caffeic acid, catechol, furfural, hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide) (Table 2). The evidence on coffee and human health has been recently reviewed, and the evidence to date is insufficient to show that coffee is a risk factor for cancer in humans (81, 86). The same caution about the implications for humans of rodent carcinogens in the diet that were discussed above for nature's pesticides apply to coffee and the products of cooked food. Clastogenicity and Mutagenicity Studies. Results from in vitro studies also indicate that the natural world should not be ignored and that positive results are commonly observed in high-dose protocols. Ishidate et al. (26) reviewed experi- ments on the clastogenicity (ability to break chromosomes) of 951 chemicals in mammalian cell cultures. Of these 951 chemicals, we identified 72 as natural plant pesticides, and 35 (48%) were positive for clastogenicity in at least one test. This is similar to the results for the remaining chemicals, of which 467/879 (53%) were positive in at least one test. Of particular interest are the levels at which some of the carcinogenic plant toxins in Table 2 were clastogenic (26). Allyl isothiocyanate was clastogenic at a concentration of 0.0005 ppm, which is about 200,000 times less than the concentration of sinigrin, its glucosinolate, in cabbage. Allyl isothiocyanate was among the most potent chemicals in the compendium (26) and is also effective at unusually low levels in transforming (96) and mutating (30) animal cells. (See also the discussion of cancer tests in Table 1.) Safrole was clastogenic at a concentration of about 100 ppm, which is 30 times less than the concentration in nutmeg and roughly equal to the concentration in black pepper. The rodent carcinogens safrole and estragole, and a number of other related dietary natural pesticides that have not been tested in animal cancer tests, have been shown to produce DNA adducts in mice (97). Caffeic acid was clastogenic at a concentration of 260 and 500 ppm, which is less than its concentration in roasted coffee beans and close to its concentration in apples, lettuce, endive, and potato skin. Chlorogenic acid, a precursor of caffeic acid, was clastogenic at a concentration of 150 ppm, which is 100 times less than its concentration in roasted coffee beans and similar to its concentration in apples, pears, plums, peaches, cherries, and apricots. Chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid are also mutagens (Table 1). Coffee is genotoxic to mammalian cells (98). Plant phenolics such as caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and tannins (esters of gallic acid) have been reviewed for their mutagenicity and antimutagenicity, clas- togenicity, and carcinogenicity (99).

Carcinogen tests are referenced in refs. 10-13 and the following: 5-methoxypsoralen (light-activated) and 8-methoxypsoralen (46, 47) (psoralen, which is carcinogenic by skin painting, and many other mutagenic psoralen derivatives are also present in parsley and celery); p-hydrazinobenzoate and glutamyl p-hydrazinobenzoate (48, 49); allyl isothiocyanate (31, 32); D-limonene (50); estragole and safrole (45, 51); ethyl acrylate and benzyl acetate (52); a-methylbenzyl alcohol (53); caffeic acid (37); sesamol (37); catechol (37). Concentration references are as follows: 5- and 8-methoxypsoralen (17, 55-59); p-hydrazinobenzoates (in commercial mushrooms) (48, 49); sinigrin (38-40, 60); D-limonene (61-63); estragole and safrole (64-67); ethyl acrylate (68); benzyl acetate (69-71), a-methylbenzyl alcohol (23); caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and neochlorogenic acid (72-80) [in coffee (81)]; catechol (83, 84); sesamol (85). For mutagenicity and clastogenicity references, see text. *Sinigrin is a cocarcinogen (33) and is metabolized to the rodent carcinogen allyl isothiocyanate, although no adequate test has been done on sinigrin itself. The proportion converted to allyl isothiocyanate or to allyl cyanide depends on food preparation (38-40). tChlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid are metabolized to the carcinogens caffeic acid and catechol (a metabolite of quinic acid) but have not been tested for carcinogenicity themselves. The clastogenicity and mutagenicity of these compounds are referenced in Table 1.

**Summary:**

**It is probable that almost every fruit and vegetable in the supermarket contains natural plant pesticides that are rodent carcinogens. The levels of these 27 rodent carcinogens in the above plants are commonly thousands of times higher than the levels of synthetic pesticides.**
