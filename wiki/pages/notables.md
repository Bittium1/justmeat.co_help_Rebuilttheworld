  > Hi, my name is Paul Mabry.  I’m a retired Family Medicine doctor born in 1950 so I’ve seen a lot of things in my life.  The Reader’s Digest biography is that I was born inTexas farming country outside Houston, moved to a top notch School District when I was 12, Joined the Navy when I was 19 and was trained as a Russian Linguist, spent 3 years in Japan flying on EC-121s/P3’s and crewing submarines to intercept communications along the Russian coast, worked at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston for 2 years to support the Joint Space Mission with the Russians called “Apollo-Soyuz”, went back to college winding up with 3 degrees (BA in Spanish Literature, BS in Biology and a BS in Medical Technology).  I then completed Medical School rejoined the Navy and did my Internship at Bethesda Naval Hospital.  After 9 years as a doctor in the Navy including a deployment to a field hospital in the Saudi Desert during the First Gulf War I returned to civilian practice to give my autistic daughter more stability and completed a Family Medicine Residency at St. Clare’s Hospital in Schenectady, NY.  In 2001 I joined the New York Army National Guard and did 2 deployments to Iraq, 1 deployment to Afghanistan (almost 2 years total in combat zones).  I switched to the active duty Army and retired with 26 years of total service.  I have since had a career writing and producing Audiobooks under the pseudonym “Somerset Hamilton”. This year I attended both national low carb conferences (Breckenridge and San Diego) and summarized the presentation of every speaker.   I play my piano at least an hour a day, play tennis 3-4 times per week minimum, hike frequently in local parks including 3 trips to the top of the Sandia Mountains overlooking Albuquerque  with my daughter this summer (which is a minimum 7 mile, 4,500 ft vertical rise hike), work on old cars and motorcycles, and blog on health and nutrition topics among many other hobbies.  **At 67 years young all this activity is fueled by a high fat, moderate protein Zero Carb diet plus intermittent fasting.** [BornToEatMeat.com](https://borntoeatmeat.com/?page_id=894)

  > **paulsaladinomd** 
What's up guys?! Lots of new folks following recently so I thought I'd introduce myself again. I'm a classically trained MD, and was a physician assistant in cardiology prior to this. I returned to med school in 2011, after 4 years as a PA. Frustrated with the symptom focused and pharmaco-centric paradigm I was a part of, I eventually discovered functional medicine and ways of thinking aimed at "root cause medicine." ⠀
  > During med school I really enjoyed internal medicine, and my dad is an internist (runs in the family I guess), but the human side of psychiatry really grabbed me. I enjoyed the narrative aspect of the work, and was struck by the human aspect of the poignant stories patients told me. For the last four years I've been at the University of Washington completing a residency in psychiatry, which I will finish this June. ⠀
  > Sadly, my experience in residency has been fairly similar to my experiences in med school, and as a PA. The mainstream paradigm remains symptom focused and pharmaceutical based. From atherosclerosis, to autoimmunity, to depression, the paradigm remains the same, and this is what I am a part of changing. ⠀
  > Interventions involving diet have been the some of the most powerful that I've discovered during my career in medicine. Of these, over the last year I've become fascinated with the carnivore diet and the myriad stories of people with mental health issues and autoimmunity improving on this diet. I've talked at length about this type of diet in podcasts, here, and on my YouTube channel, and I'll not stop extolling it's virtues any time soon! I'm extremely grateful to be at this point in my career, and excited for the future. Next is a move to San Diego with a private practice there, a book, and many other adventures. Thanks for being part of this journey! ⠀⠀[_instagram_](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvScfBxlLIh/)
