  > The environmental impacts of beef cattle production and their effects on the overall sustainability of beef have
become a national and international concern. Our objective was to quantify important environmental impacts of
beef cattle production in the United States. Surveys and visits of farms, ranches and feedlots were conducted
throughout seven regions (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northern Plains, Southern Plains, Northwest and
Southwest) to determine common practices and characteristics of cattle production. These data along with other
information sources were used to create about 150 representative production systems throughout the country,
which were simulated with the Integrated Farm System Model using local soil and climate data. The simulations
quantified the performance and environmental impacts of beef cattle production systems for each region. A farmgate life cycle assessment was used to quantify resource use and emissions for all production systems including
traditional beef breeds and cull animals from the dairy industry. Regional and national totals were determined as
the sum of the production system outputs multiplied by the number of cattle represented by each simulated
system. The average annual greenhouse gas and reactive N emissions associated with beef cattle production over
the past five years were determined to be 243 ± 26 Tg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) and 1760 ± 136 Gg
N, respectively. Total fossil energy use was found to be 569 ± 53 PJ and blue water consumption was
23.2 ± 3.5 TL. Environmental intensities expressed per kg of carcass weight produced were 21.3 ± 2.3 kg
CO2e, 155 ± 12 g N, 50.0 ± 4.7 MJ, and 2034 ± 309 L, respectively. These farm-gate values are being combined with post farm-gate sources of packing, processing, distribution, retail, consumption and waste handling to
produce a full life cycle assessment of U.S. beef. This study is the most detailed, yet comprehensive, study
conducted to date to provide baseline measures for the sustainability of U.S. beef.

* [Positioning for the Future of Beef Production - Focus on Sustainability](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326235108_Positioning_for_the_Future_of_Beef_Production_-_Focus_on_Sustainability)

  > Sustainability is about balancing economic, social, and environmental concerns and positive attributes (i.e., the triple bottom line) and having a long-term focus (i.e., meeting the needs of the present without sacriﬁ cing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; UN, 1987). Much of the focus in recent years on beef and sustainability has been on environmental impacts, and in particular, beef’s higher environmental footprints (e.g., carbon, water, and land) relative to other foods when expressed per pound or per unit of crude protein (Poore and Nemecek, 2018). The relative diff erences in environmental footprints of foods has led to recommendations to consume more plantbased foods, or switch to pork, poultry, and ﬁ sh over beef. Additionally, the environmental footprints of beef and other animal proteins has been a key focus of so-called “plantbased meats” and is a driving force behind the development of cell culture-derived muscle tissues that are yet to come to market. Ultimately, a prevailing narrative in food-informed and environmentally-concerned consumer, media, and investment circles has been “eat less meat for better human and planetary health” or “less meat, less heat” referring to curbing climate change by consuming fewer animal-derived foods, with a focus on beef.

I am a faculty member in the Department of Animal Science at the University of California, Davis. We are specialized in measurements and mitigation of greenhouse gases, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and particulate matter and the study of their effects on human- and animal health and welfare. In short, our lab investigates the nexus of agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.

  > By 2050, Earth will be home to nearly 10 billion people, a tripled human population during our lifetime. Only 1.8% of the Earth’s surface is arable land that can be used for growing crops, a resource not likely to increase, which means the amount of cropland per person will decline by 20% (1). In the face of finite resources and a changing climate, we need sustainable solutions to the 2050 food challenge. Our current food system is often criticized for not addressing chronic undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and obesity. And agriculture does contribute to issues of environmental sustainability. Livestock production is often seen as particularly egregious, and some people say we can better meet the 2050 food challenge by limiting or eliminating animal-source foods from our diet. Critics of animal agriculture go as far as to claim that globally, livestock produces more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector. Less livestock production would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, provide more food for humans by decreasing feed needed for livestock, and free up rangeland and feedlots for crop production. In short - Eat less meat to save the environment. At first glance, this simple solution seems elegant and one that should be readily adopted. However, the truth is far more complicated as discussed in the present paper.
