* **1797** - [_An account of two cases of the diabetes mellitus_](https://archive.org/details/b21469179_0002/page/26) by Dr. John Rollo of Woolrich

    > "It was agreed to try the effects of animal food. He is directed to abstain from vegetable food in every shape. To have two eggs for breakfast. Boiled meat and steaks alternately for dinner. Eggs, or cheese for supper. For drink eight pounds of weak beef tea, and two pounds of weak peppermint water. Solid ingested about two pounds. "


* **1798** - ["A case of the Diabetes Mellitus, which terminated in a complete, and, as far as can be judged by apparent Circumstances, a permanent Cure, by Medicines, abstracting Oxygen from the System, and a Diet consisting totally of Animal Matter."]() by R. Redfearn M.D. of Lynn Regis, Norfolk

    > "I therefore immediately suggested to him the propriety, and the absolute necessity, of abstaining ridigly from all fermented liquors and vegetables, with everything else that could impart oxygen to the system by the primae viae; and at the same time ordered that his diet should consist principally of **fat beef, pork,** and such ailments as were of a gross or unctuous quality, and most likely to produce hydrogen in the greatest abundance. After this patient had persevered in the above medicines and regiment during a fortnight only, he found his thirst by no means so excessive. The quantity of his urine was considerably diminished, and became also of a quality more urinous, and less sweet. His amendment continued to be progressive, without feeling any interruption, either from natural or adventitious causes; and he was completely free from every symtom of the disease in less than three months after the medicines were first administered. He never once deviated from the regimen prescribed. My patient has now continued perfectly well for more than eight months, and to my enquires, very lately, he declared, that he never enjoyed a better state of health, than he does at the moment."

* **1863** - [_Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public_](https://archive.org/details/letteroncorpulen00bant) by William Banting

    > Banting accounted all of his unsuccessful fasts, diets, spa and exercise regimens in his past. His previously unsuccessful attempts had been on the advice of various medical experts. He then described the dietary change which finally had worked for him, following the advice of another medical expert. "My kind and valued medical adviser is not a doctor for obesity, but stands on the pinnacle of fame in the treatment of another malady, which, as he well knows, is frequently induced by [corpulence]." (p24) His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, saccharine matter, starch, beer, milk and butter.

* **1888** - [_The Relation of Alimentation and Disease_](/docs/the-relation-of-alimentation-and-disease-j-h-salisbury.pdf) by J. H. Salisbury, A.M., M.D., LL. D.

    > "It may safely be affirmed that all chronic diseases which afflict the human organism, aside from those arising from injuries, poisons, and infections, have their genesis and development in something we are doing every day; or at least, in something to which we expose ourselves at regulary and frequently repeated intervals. These various occurrences include drinks and food; the kind, condition and proportions of each used ; the state and rapidity with which they are taken in ; the intervals at which they are drunk and eaten, and the quantities of each consumed."

* **1916** - ["The Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1584654/pdf/canmedaj00331-0019.pdf) by Elliott P. Joslin, M.D. Boston, Massachusetts

    > "Alternate feeding and fasting are adopted when it is found that the glycosuria persists after a preliminary four days' fast. The
method which I have found most successful has been to allow, following the first fasting period, 20 to 40 grams carbohydrate not far from half a gram per kilogram body weight-and about one gram of protein per kilogram for two days.This can be avoided by still further restricting the carbohydrate, either temporarily or permanently. It is always necessary to bear in mind that one food which the diabetic patient cannot do without is protein, and to it everything else must be subservient. While testing the protein tolerance, a small quantity of fat is included in the eggs and meat given."

    > "Restriction of carbohydrate, alone, appears to make possible the treatment of obesity on a calorically unrestricted diet composed chiefly of protein and fat. The limiting factor on appetite, necessary to any treatment of obesity, appears to be provided by increased mobilization and utilization of fat, in conjunction with the homeostatic forces which normally regulate the appetite. Ketogensis appears to be a key factor in the increased utilization of fat. Treatment of obesity by this method appears to avoid the decline in the metabolism encountered in treatment by caloric restriction. Details of diet and regimen are given."

    > Dr. Donaldson in STRONG MEDICINE expresses his personal concept of treatment for six highly important and frequently deadly diseases--arteriosclerosis, osteoarthritis, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and gall bladder disease. His book is interesting, informative, humorous, and highly controversial.
    > "From what I have observed, a half pound of meat per meal is the minimum quantity needed to maintain the work of repair of body cells."
    > "Oh, there were dozens of questions I wanted to discuss with Stefannsson, so Fred Taylor brought him out to my home on Long Island. Some steamed clams and a good steak loosened him up, and we sat around a beach fire and talked for hours. He proved to be a mine of information. As I remember his conversation, it went something like this..."

* **1963** - [_The Diet of the Mountain Men_](/docs/the-diet-of-the-mountain-men-william-e-holsten.pdf) by William E. Holston

    > "The trapper's diet, in particular, mirrored the Indian way of life. Both the mountain men and Indians had to live off the land. Their diet was largely meat, especially the flesh of the bison. Elk was probably second in consumption for most of the trappers. Less frequently, the mountain men ate deer, bear, antelope, horses, dogs, beaver, and other small game."

* **1964** - [_Cardiovascular Disease in the Masai_](/docs/Mann%201964%20Masai%20study.pdf) by G.V. Mann, R.D.

    > "These studies, like those of SHAPER among the Samburu and of GSELL AND MAYER among the mountain Swiss show no support for the contention that a large intake of dairy fat and meat necessarily causes either hypercholesterolemia or coronary heart disease. Indeed, if such dietary habits are causes of hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis and clinical cardiovascular disease, one must invoke overriding protective mechanisms among the Masai. It cannot be a failure to reach the susceptible age. We should have found coronary heart disease among the 233 Masai men examined who were 30 years or over if the prevalence rate is near that of American men."

* **1964** - [_The Drinking Man’s Diet_](https://timeline.com/drinking-mans-diet-carbs-82a38400bfff) by Robert Cameron ([50th Anniversary Ed.](http://cameronbooks.com/product/the-drinking-mans-diet-50th-anniversary-edition/))

    > "What was his secret? Meat and booze, simply put. Cameron reported his findings to the world in his self-published 1962 book, The Drinking Man’s Diet. It quickly became one of the most popular diets in the country, selling 2.4 million copies in 13 languages. Cameron had initiated a “carbo-craze” by suggesting that weight watchers count carbs not calories. When Atkins released Diet Revolution nine years later, Cameron responded, “Revolution? My foot!” He had been proselytizing against carbs for a decade already."

* **1972** - [_Pure, White, and Deadly_](https://www.amazon.com/Pure-White-Deadly-John-Yudkin/dp/0241965284) by Dr. John Yudkin

    > "John Yudkin was one of the first to point out the dangers of sugar when he published the original edition of _Pure, White, and Deadly_ in 1972. Now, in this extensively rewritten and expanded edition, he reveals the new evidence about the dangers of sugar and its drastic consquences for our health. In everyday language Professor Yudkin explains how sugar consumption is linked to diabetes, heart and liver disease, dental caries and other conditions. He pays particular attention to its effects on young children and shows how they, like everyone else, can benefit from reduced sugar intake. He also examines the role of the sugar industry, which has made strenous efforts to dismiss the case against sugar."

* **1975** - [_The Stone Age Diet_](/docs/the-stone-age-diet-walter-l-voegtlin.pdf) by Dr. Walter L. Voegtlin, M.D., F.A.C.P.

    > This book is a study of the ecology of Man, as his environment has changed with (relatively) lightning-like rapidity from prehistorical to modern times, and to delineate the effect these changes have had on nutrition. An attempt will be made to answer the question: "Is modern Man actually better or worse off nutritionally than was his Stone Age forbear?"
    >
    > Writing this book has indeed been fun. While collecting material for the early chapters I was able to add greatly to my knowledge of comparative anatomy and physiology, how all various sorts of animals are constructed, and how their digestive tracts function. Later chapters led me into a fascinating world of the past, of anthropology and archaeology, which I embraced enthusiastically though amateurishly. Finally I ventured into the shadowy sphere of philosophy, explored some aspects of future food production, and have set down the dire predictions of population ecologists for the arrival of the 21st century. It has been thrilling to see how each bit of scientific data from such widely separated disciplines fitted together into a mosaic of such undeniable clarity that the aphorism: "That contrary to Nature cannot be fact"-was again verified, this time in the field of human dietetics and nutrition.

* **1987** - [“The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race”](http://www.ditext.com/diamond/mistake.html) by Jared Diamond

    > "There are many things that we seldom question; the truth seems so evident and the answers obvious. One such sacred cow is the tremendous prosperity brought about by the agricultural revolution. This selection is a thought-provoking introduction to the connection between culture and agriculture. The transition from food foraging to farming (what archaeoloqists call the Neolithic revolution) may have been the worst mistake human history or its most important event. You be the judge. But for better or worse, this cultural evolution has occurred, and the world will never be the same again."
